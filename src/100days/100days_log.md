# 100 Days of Code Commitment

This is my commitment for starting and completing the 100 Days of Code Challenge.

# I will code for at least an hour every day.
# I will Tweet my progress daily using the #100DaysOfCode. 
# I will commit to GitHub, and my journey Blog
# Work time is not coding time...[going to be hard]
# I will support others through their code journey.
# I will not skip more than 2 days in a row.

Each day I will post:

To Twitter
To Instagram
To Github 
To CodePen
