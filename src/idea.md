This is the new idea for set up 
thought of on February 6

NiKoleMaxwell.com = main site
fun, flexible witty nerdy

bright and fun -- seafoam green, fushia and gray and white ofc

Previews of my portfolio will go here
links to associated examples will point to NVY
==================
GH Pages....fits somewhere in the middle -- or not at all?
==================

Feeds into the NVY company which will be used as a demo for applications for business

so things like dorky business forms, database reports apis things like that

NM will be sleek, business clean and crisp cohesive work of art  modern but futuristic, operations based

living body of work

EXAMPLES of my portfolio will be here -- the real thing with links to the previews on NM

==================
